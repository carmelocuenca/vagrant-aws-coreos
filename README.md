# A Vagrantfile for a CoreOS Cluster in Amazon Web Services

## Version 0.3
The file ```use-data.sample``` define a unit (```systemd``` ) ```nginx.fleet.service``` which launchs a ```nginx.service``` in all
machine with metadata ```host=hello-world```. The file ```config.rb.sample```
instruments the metadata.

Services (AWS). The file ```use-data.sample``` define a unit (```systemd``` ) ```hello-world.fleet.service``` which launchs a ```hello-world.service``` in all
machine with metadata ```host=hello-world```. The file ```config.rb.sample```

## Version 0.1
A ```Vagrantfile``` to launch ```$num_instances``` with CoreOS in Amazon Web
Services (AWS). It also launchs a ```hello-world``` unit systemd.


## Requirements

It is necessary to have installed Vagrant (of course) and the plugin for using
AWS. All information about the plugin is in the URL https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant-aws.

To install the vagrant-aws plugin execute
```
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-aws
```

## What is each file?

* ```Vagrantfile``` What can I say about this file?
* ```user-data``` A cloud-config file to upload to AWS in setup time.
* ```config.rb``` Ruby code to instrument the ```user-data``` file.


## How does it work?
Setup an initial configuraion
```
$ cp user-data.sample user-data
$ cp config.rb.sample config.rb
```
an then up the infraestructure
```
$ vagrant up --provider aws
```

When ```vagrant up --provider aws``` is executed, Vagrant loads the file
```config.rb``` which adds a discovery token to ```user-data``` file and it
rewrite the file ```user-data```.
It uses the discovery service given by the cloud service (insecure) https://discovery.etcd.io/new?size=#{$num_instances}.
The global variable ```$num_instances``` fixs the number of instances.
This is not a solution for production environment because all machine needs Internet access.

The ```Vagranfile``` could set the fields  ```access_key_id``` and ```aws_secret_key```.
Insted of that the home directory contains the file ```~/.aws/credentials```.
This file is used by the API when both the access_key and the secret_key is not set.

```~/.aws/credentials``` file should look like similar to
```
[default]
aws_access_key_id=AKIAZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
aws_secret_access_key=ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
```

Don't forget to kill all EC2 instances (money is money)
```
$ vagrant destroy -f
```

## Service etcd2
After the infraestructure is deployed, we can check the service etcd2 with
```
vagrant ssh core-01 -c 'etcdctl member list'
```
or
```
$ vagrant ssh core-01 -c 'etcdctl cluster-health'
```
and the CoreOS should be healthy

## Service hello-world
Cheack the availability of service hello-world with
```
$ vagrant ssh core-01 -c 'journalctl -u hello-world'
```
or
```
$ vagrant ssh core-01 -c 'systemctl status hello-world'
```

## Is something wrong?
Obtain more logs from Vagrant

```
$ vagrant up --debug
```

* When we destroy and up quickly it happens the message
```InUse => Address 10.0.0.x is in use```. Be patient and try again.
* Are you in the free layer? You can only have 3 machines up, so check if you
have more than 3 machines in all zones.


## More?
* Multitenant
* ELK
* Monitoring
* Scaling
* Terraform
